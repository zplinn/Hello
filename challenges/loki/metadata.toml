challenge_description = '''
A mysterious binary has appeared, but something seems... off. Extract the
correct flag from "reverseme" and send it to the waiting listener to gain
access. But beware - Loki is known for his tricks.

challenge_spoilers = '''
A reverse engineering challenge featuring a heavily obfuscated
binary that uses anti-analysis techniques targeting popular
tools like Ghidra, IDA, Binary Ninja, and angr. Players must
extract a flag from the binary, which when sent to the network
listener (after SHA256 validation) grants shell access.
